# Film-Booking-Project_Inmakes
Film Ticket Booking System project, built using Spring Boot, aims to streamline the movie ticket booking process.

Purpose:

The goal is to simplify the movie-going experience by letting users browse films, check showtimes, pick seats, and book tickets all in one place.

Tools Used:

You built this with Spring Boot for the backend, which handles the data, services, and requests smoothly.
MySQL stores all the essential details, like movie listings, user profiles, showtimes, and reservations.
The frontend, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, is designed to be responsive and user-friendly.
